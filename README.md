## Extra Credit Details

### Additional User Role (Manager)

We decided to implement a manger user role as our additional role. It is a user object in our system and holds the most permissions including add, edit, and delete recipe, add ingredient, add inventory, order history, and creating staff acounts.

### Order History

We chose to implement the order history requirement, this is accesible by a manager user and shows a history of each order in the system, it's complete/picked up status, and the name of the user who made the order.

### Anonymous Orders

We chose to implement the anonymous orders requirment, this is shown through a guest user, which is accesible through the login page, the guest acts as a customer account without credientials. The guest can order coffee and see their orders all anonymously.
